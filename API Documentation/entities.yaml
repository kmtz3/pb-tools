    Productboard API v2 for managing the following Entities: 
      - product
      - component
      - feature
      - subfeature
      - initiative
      - objective
      - keyResult
      - release
      - releaseGroup
      - user (requires New Customer Board Beta)
      - company (requires New Customer Board Beta)

    ## Configuration-Driven API

    This API is universal and respects the configuration of your Productboard workspace. 
    The available fields, their types, and capabilities are determined by your workspace 
    configuration, permissions, and business logic.

    ## Field Discovery

    To discover what fields are available for each entity type and their capabilities, 
    use the `/v2/entities/configuration` endpoint. This introspection endpoint returns:
    - Available fields (both standard and custom)
    - Field types and validation rules
    - Supported operations (read, create, update)
    - Available patch operations (set, addItems, removeItems, clear)
    - Required vs optional fields

    ## Universal Entity Support

    The API provides a unified interface for all listed entities. Each entity type 
    supports the same core operations (create, read, update, delete, search) while respecting 
    the specific configuration and field definitions for that entity type in your workspace.

    ## Dynamic Field System

    Custom fields are identified by UUIDs and can be of various types (text, number, 
    boolean, status, member, teams, tags, single_select, multi_select, rich_text, 
    calculated, date, health, work_progress). The exact fields available depend on 
    your workspace configuration.

    get:
      summary: List entities
      description: |
        Retrieves a paginated list of Entities.  
        You can filter results, sort them, and control which fields are returned.

        Use the `type` query parameter to restrict results to a specific entity type (e.g. `feature`, `initiative`).  
        Use the `fields` parameter to request only the fields you need.

        ## Limitations
        - Only the `AND` operator is supported when applying multiple filters. `OR`, `NOT`, or nested conditions are not supported.

        Retrieves all configured fields and values for the specified Entities.  
        Use this endpoint to load complete data for a single entity.

        You can limit the fields returned using the `fields` query parameter.

    patch:
      summary: Update entity
      description: |
        Updates one or more fields of a Entities.  
        Use `fields` for full replacement of values, or `patch` for granular changes like adding/removing items in list-type fields.  
        You must use either `fields` or `patch` – not both.

        The `patch` property supports these operations:
        - `set` – same as setting a value via `fields`
        - `addItems` – add one or more values to a list field
        - `removeItems` – remove values from a list field
        - `clear` – erase the value of the field

        ## Limitations
        - Providing both `fields` and `patch` in the same request will return an error.

    delete:
      summary: Delete entity
      description: |
        Deletes a Product Management entity by ID. This operation permanently removes the specified entity from your workspace.

        If the entity has any child entities (e.g. a product with components, or a feature with subfeatures), those children will be **deleted automatically** as part of a cascading delete.

        **Use this endpoint with caution — deletion is irreversible.**
      operationId: deleteEntityById
      parameters:

  /entities/search:
    post:
      summary: Search entities
      description: |
        Performs a filtered search over Entities using a POST request.  
        This endpoint supports the same filtering capabilities as `GET /v2/entities`, but allows a larger and more complex payload.  
        It's useful when filtering by a long list of foreign key IDs or when URL length limits become a problem.

        ## Limitations
        - Only the `AND` operator is supported when applying multiple filters. `OR`, `NOT`, or nested conditions are not supported.
        - You can search only within one entity type at a time.
      operationId: searchEntities

      summary: Create relationship
      description: |
        Creates a relationship between two Entities.  
        Specify the source entity via the URL path (`{id}`), and the target entity and relationship type in the request body.

        The `type` field determines the direction and nature of the relationship.  
        Supported values:
        - `parent` – declare the target as the parent of the source
        - `child` – declare the target as the child of the source
        - `link` – create a non-hierarchical connection between entities
        - `isBlockedBy` – create a dependency between entities
        - `isBlocking` – create a dependency between entities

        ## Limitations
        - Only valid combinations of source and target entities are allowed for each relationship type.
        - The target entity must exist and be accessible.

  /entities/{id}/relationships/parent:
    put:
      summary: Set parent relationship
      description: |
        Replaces the parent of a specific Entities.  
        Some entity types (such as features and subfeatures) are required to have a parent.  
        This endpoint allows you to update the parent entity when the relationship changes.

        The new parent is specified in the request body using the `target.id` field.

        ## Limitations
        - Only valid parent relationships are allowed (e.g. feature → component, subfeature → feature).
        - The target entity must exist and be a valid parent type.
        - This will overwrite any existing parent relationship.

        A collection of fields that can be used to create or update a PM entity.
        It is a subset of `EntityFields` that is used for creation or update operations.

        ## Dual Format Support
        Most field types support two input formats:
        - **Simple format**: Direct value (e.g., `"text"`, `123`, `true`)
        - **Object format**: Value with metadata (e.g., `{"value": "text", "metadata": {...}}`)

        ## Metadata Support
        Custom fields (identified by UUID) and specific field types (`domain`, `email`, `effort`) support 
        optional metadata that allows tracking the external source of field values:
        - `source.externalSystemName`: Name of the external system that provided the value
        - `source.externalRecordId`: Identifier of the record in the external system
        - `isViewableOnly`: Whether the value is read-only from external source

        Metadata sent for other fields is ignored.

    HealthUpdateFieldValue:
      description: |
        Represents the health status of a Entities, either manually set or automatically calculated.

        This object contains:
        - The mode of health tracking (`manual` or `calculated`)
        - The health `status` (required only when mode is `manual`)
        - An optional `comment` to provide context
        - Metadata on who created the update (`createdBy`)

        ### Behavior
        - If `mode` is `"manual"`, the `status` field is **required**, and you may include an optional `comment`.
        - If `mode` is `"calculated"`, **do not provide** the `status` or `comment` fields – they will be ignored or cause validation errors.

        ### Use cases
        - Set `manual` mode to explicitly assign a health status with reasoning.
        - Use `calculated` mode when health is derived from internal logic or automation within Productboard.

        ### Examples

        **Manual mode:**
        ```json
        {
          "mode": "manual",
          "status": "atRisk",
          "comment": "Project timeline at risk due to resource constraints"
        }
        ```

        **Calculated mode:**
        ```json
        {
          "mode": "calculated"
        }
        ```

    ProgressFieldValue:
      type: object
      description: |
        Measurable progress tracking for key results with start, target, and current values.

        This object contains:
        - A `startValue` representing the baseline measurement
        - A `targetValue` representing the goal to achieve
        - A `currentValue` representing the present measurement

        ## Behavior
        - All values are floating-point numbers allowing decimal precision
        - Values can represent various metrics (percentages, counts, amounts, etc.)
        - The `currentValue` is updated to track progress toward the `targetValue`
        - Progress calculation: `(currentValue - startValue) / (targetValue - startValue) * 100`
        - Supports both positive and negative progress directions
        - Currently supported only for key results
        - Used to track quantifiable metrics like revenue, users, and performance indicators

        ## Examples

        **Percentage-based progress:**
        ```json
        {
          "startValue": 0.0,
          "targetValue": 100.0,
          "currentValue": 75.5
        }
        ```

        **Revenue tracking:**
        ```json
        {
          "startValue": 50000.0,
          "targetValue": 100000.0,
          "currentValue": 87500.0
        }
        ```

        **User count growth:**
        ```json
        {
          "startValue": 1000.0,
          "targetValue": 5000.0,
          "currentValue": 3250.0
        }
        ```

    WorkProgressFieldValue:
      type: object
      description: |
        Work progress percentage for Entities, tracking completion status from 0-100%.

        This object contains:
        - A numeric `value` representing completion percentage (0-100)
        - A `mode` indicating how the progress is calculated (`manual`, `statusBased`, or `calculated`)

        ## Behavior
        - The `value` field must be an integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive)
        - The `mode` field determines how progress is tracked and updated:
          - `manual`: Progress is set directly by users
          - `statusBased`: Progress is automatically calculated based on entity status
          - `calculated`: Progress is derived from child entity relationships (parent/link)
        - Different entity types support different modes:
          - **subfeature**: `manual`, `statusBased`
          - **feature**: `manual`, `statusBased`, `calculated`
          - **initiative**: `manual`, `calculated`
          - **objective**: `manual`, `calculated`
        - When mode is `calculated`, the system automatically updates the value based on relationships
        - Used to track completion percentage across the product hierarchy and monitor progress aggregation

        ## Examples

        **Manual progress:**
        ```json
        {
          "value": 75,
          "mode": "manual"
        }
        ```

        **Status-based progress:**
        ```json
        {
          "value": 50,
          "mode": "statusBased"
        }
        ```

        **Calculated progress from relationships:**
        ```json
        {
          "value": 85,
          "mode": "calculated"
        }
        ```
