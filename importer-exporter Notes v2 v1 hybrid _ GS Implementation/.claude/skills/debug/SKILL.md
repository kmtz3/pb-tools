# Debug Skill
1. Read the error message/logs provided by the user carefully.
2. Identify the ROOT CAUSE — not the surface symptom. State your hypothesis.
3. Search the codebase for similar patterns that already work correctly.
4. Propose a single targeted fix. Do NOT make excessive changes.
5. After applying the fix, verify by reading the modified code for syntax errors and logical correctness.
